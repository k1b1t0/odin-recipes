    <p>
        Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation method. 
        It's cooked short-grain white rice combined with rice vinegar and other ingredients, 
        cooled completely, and then used to make sushi rolls.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Rinse rice under cold water in a strainer until water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 12 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until tender, 10 minutes more. The rice will continue to steam. Remove lid and let rice cool.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved. Allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Stir vinegar mixture into rice. It may look wet at first, but keep stirring; rice will dry as it cools.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
